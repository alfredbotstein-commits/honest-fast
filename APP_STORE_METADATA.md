## Description
Honest Fast is a fasting timer that respects you.

No subscriptions. No ads. No account required.
Pay once ($6.99), own it forever.

• Beautiful timer with fasting stage tracking
• Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Live Activity widgets
• Apple Watch app and complications
• All major protocols: 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, OMAD, custom
• Full fasting history with streak tracking
• Weekly charts and calendar heat map
• Export your data anytime (CSV)
• Works offline. Your data stays on your device.

Built for people who are tired of $70/year fasting apps.

Every other fasting app hides a subscription behind a "free" download. We don't. You pay once, you own it, we leave you alone. No accounts, no cloud, no analytics — your fasting data stays on your device and nowhere else.

Fasting stages show commonly referenced metabolic milestones (fat burning, ketosis, autophagy) so you can see where you are in your fast. Simple. Honest. Done.
